"""One run is one country, and the failure these tests exist to prevent succeeds quietly.

A run that reads Lithuania and writes under `work/LV/` uploads cleanly, produces a valid
index, and hands a Latvian reader Lithuanian tenders with nothing anywhere saying so. There
is no error to notice. So the rule is structural rather than checked after the fact: the
source and the destination are both derived from one resolved code, and every way of
expressing a mismatch is refused at the point it is expressed.

THIS REPOSITORY FETCHES ONE COUNTRY, AND THAT MAKES THE CHECK MORE IMPORTANT, NOT LESS.
Latvia is now a code this tool has no source for, so `--country LV` is refused here by the
same line that refuses `EE` — which is exactly the guarantee a country-per-repository split
has to provide. The Lithuanian tool cannot be pointed at Latvia's portal, and it cannot be
pointed at Latvia's folder.
