"""The gate check inside `lt-day.yml` runs, against a policy of every shape.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The check is a few lines of Python embedded in a YAML string, so nothing
imported it and nothing ran it. It used to unpack `load_policy` into four names; on
28 Aug 2026 the recall codes became a fifth field and the step began dying with
`ValueError: too many values to unpack`. Two whole nights were lost before anybody looked,
and the reason nobody looked is that the failure was in the step whose entire job is to
stop a bad night — a guard that is itself unguarded.

The test extracts the real script out of the real workflow and executes it. It fails if the
step stops surviving a policy field that `policy.load_policy` is willing to return.
