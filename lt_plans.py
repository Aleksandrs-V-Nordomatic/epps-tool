"""The Lithuanian procurement plans: what buyers say they are going to buy.

Not a stream and not a tender. Every contracting authority must publish its annual plan in
CVP IS and republish it within five working days of amending it, so the register is a stock
that keeps being refreshed rather than a day's worth of news. What it buys us is lead time:
an object appears here as a line in a spreadsheet months before it appears anywhere as a
notice.

WHERE IT LIVES, and this is the part that costs a day if taken from the obvious place. The
plan register on `cvpp.eviesiejipirkimai.lt` is FROZEN — the newest publication date
anywhere in it is 2 December 2024, plan year 2025 holds three rows and 2026 none. The whole
CVPP portal stopped receiving data on that date. The live register is in EPPS, at
`app/viewPublication.do`, and on 24 August 2026 it held 1,424 plans for the 2026 cycle with
submission timestamps from that same morning.

ONE FILE PER BUYER, ONE SHAPE FOR ALL OF THEM. Each plan is an `.xls` on a mandatory VPT
template: sheets `DUOMENYS` and `TYPES`, a four-line header naming the buyer and the
financial year, then a row per planned procurement. Measured over ten buyers: 3,688 lines,
one schema, and `BVPŽ kodas` filled on 91% of them — so the same CPV gate that runs on
notices runs here.
