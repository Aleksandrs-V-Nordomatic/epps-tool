"""Discovery for Lithuania: which procurements a window contains.

`batch.targets_from` does this for Latvia by walking the IUB register and resolving each
notice to its EIS page — real work, because the register's API never returns the platform
link. Lithuania needs none of that. EPPS searches its own publications by date, so a window
is one POST and the ids come back already addressed.

TWO POPULATIONS, ONE PASS. Tenders and market consultations are the same kind of resource
here, told apart by the `Pirkimo būdas` column. Consultations never appear in the portal's
"newest procurements" list — measured over 600 rows across nine working days, not one — so
a discovery that crawled that list would silently lose the population publishing DRAFT
technical specifications. The window search is a different query and carries them already,
which is why this asks once and reads the kind off the row: asking a second time with
`procedure=…pmc` returns the same records again, and a run that concatenated the two would
fetch every consultation twice and count the day wrong.

THE SEARCH IS STATEFUL, and getting that wrong looks like success. Criteria go in a POST
to `viewCFTSAction.do`, and the filtered results come back in that POST's own response.
A follow-up GET to the results page returns the UNFILTERED list — the same 200, the same
table, the wrong tenders. So every page is its own POST.
