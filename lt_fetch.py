"""Transport for Lithuania: one procurement, whole, into a home.

`eis_fetch` is 640 lines because EIS resists — a third of runner addresses are refused, the
documents come one at a time behind a per-record archive negotiation, and the pacing,
retries and address lottery that make it work are most of the file. EPPS does not resist.
The whole tender is one archive from one anonymous address, so this file is short, and it
is short for a reason worth writing down rather than for lack of care.

WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH ABOUT WHAT A TENDER CONTAINS. The archive, not the catalogue.
Measured on 9320336: the document list showed eight rows, the archive held eleven members —
among them `Klausimai-atsakymai.docx`, the buyer's answers to suppliers' questions, which is
exactly the kind of document that changes a decision. So members are enumerated from the
archive and the catalogue is joined onto them for what only it knows: the amendment number
that placed a document there, and the address a person clicks. A member the catalogue does
not list is delivered anyway, marked `catalogued: false`, because a document nobody listed
still exists and silence about it is the failure this tool is written against.

MEMBERS CARRY AN ORDINAL PREFIX — `3_3. SS 1 priedas. Technine_specifikacija (TS).docx` —
which is the portal's ordering, not part of the name. It is stripped for matching and kept
in `member` so the archive can be addressed again without guessing.

The output is this project's own delivery shape, so `changes.fingerprint`, `normalize` and the
delivery read it without knowing which country it came from.
