"""One Lithuanian day, delivered: `day.json`, `changes.json`, and a home per procurement.

This is `batch.run` and `collect_day` for Lithuania, and it is one file because the two
things that made them large on the Latvian side are absent here. There is no register to
resolve against, so discovery is a window; and there is no address lottery, so there are no
shards to reconcile — a shard exists to let four runners draw four addresses at a portal
that refuses a third of them, and EPPS refuses none.

WHAT A DAY IS. The same two files a reader already knows: `changes.json` says what moved,
`day.json` says what the day contains and is written LAST, so a reader that lists folders
instead of reading it reads the wrong day. Neither holds tender bytes; both point at
`tenders/<pid>/`, which is permanent and shared across days.

WHAT MOVED IS ASKED TWICE, ON PURPOSE. `changes.fingerprint` compares the bytes of every
document, which is the floor and is what makes *the extractor rendered it differently* a
different sentence from *the buyer replaced it*. On top of that, Lithuania states the answer
outright: every catalogue row carries the number of the amendment that placed it. So a
record can say WHICH document moved and under which amendment, instead of only that
something did — which is the whole difference between an update a person can act on and one
that says a file changed.
