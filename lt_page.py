"""The Lithuanian source: one procurement on EPPS, read off its public pages.

`eis_page` does this for Latvia. This is the same two questions asked of a different
portal, and the answers are shaped identically on purpose — `parse_notice` and
`parse_documents` return what their Latvian namesakes return, so everything downstream
(normalisation, digests, index, change detection, delivery) stays country-agnostic.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT, and it is more than a base URL. Latvia's EIS is a bespoke
ASP.NET application; Lithuania's CVP IS is European Dynamics EPPS, a Java application whose
pages are label/value pairs rather than embedded JavaScript arrays. So there is no
`embedded_array` here and no field ids to prefer over labels — the label IS the identifier,
which makes the language the page was served in load-bearing. EPPS answers in Lithuanian or
English and the caller does not choose, exactly as EIS does, so every label below is given
in both and `SKELBIMO KALBA` is carried through so a reader can tell which one arrived.

THREE THINGS EPPS GIVES THAT EIS DOES NOT, and they are why this file is short:

  * the whole tender downloads as one archive from a single address, built by the portal
    rather than by us — `downloadCftResourceItems.do?resourceId=…&resourceType=…`;
  * every document row carries `Papildymo ID`, the number of the amendment that placed it
    there. A buyer replacing a specification says so in the catalogue, so a change is read
    rather than inferred — the sha256 comparison stays the floor, but the amendment number
    is what lets an update say WHICH document moved and under which amendment;
  * market consultations (`rinkos konsultacija`) are ordinary resources here, served from
    `pmc/viewPmc.do` and carrying documents through the same two endpoints. A consultation
    publishes the DRAFT technical specification, months before the tender exists.

ONE TRAP, and it is silent. EPPS returns its login form under HTTP 200 for a resourceId
that does not exist or is not public. A status code is therefore not a validity signal and
`is_published` below reads the body, exactly as its Latvian namesake has to.
