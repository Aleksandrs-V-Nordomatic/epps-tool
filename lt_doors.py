"""The standing doors: dynamic purchasing systems and qualification systems.

Neither is a tender and neither is a stream. A DPS (VPĮ 79 str.) and a KVS — the utilities'
equivalent under PĮ — are pools a buyer opens for a category and keeps open for years.
Applications are accepted for the whole life of the system and the qualification bar cannot
be changed part-way, so there is no deadline to miss and nothing to hurry. What there is, is
a door: qualify once and every actual purchase inside that category arrives as an invitation
afterwards, none of which is ever advertised.

WHY THEY NEED THEIR OWN COMMAND. A nightly window would show a DPS on the one day it was
created and never again, which is exactly backwards — the day it was created is the least
useful day to hear about it, and every day after is equally good. So these are enumerated as
a stock, on demand, and what a reader wants from them is a list to work through once rather
than a card each morning.

AND THEY HAVE NO CODES, which shapes what can be asked of them. A door is linked from the
results table to its own view, and that view answers 500 — anonymously and inside the search
session alike. So there is no card, no BVPŽ, and the gate runs on the title alone; the
absence is recorded as `cpv_available: false` rather than as an empty list, because a reader
must not take a missing code for a code that failed to match. The documents are reachable:
`listContractDocuments` and the archive answer for a door id exactly as for a tender, and
that is where the qualification requirements actually are.
